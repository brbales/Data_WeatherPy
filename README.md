What's the Weather Like?

Write a Python script to answer the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Create a Python script to gather, analyze, and visualize the weather of at least 500 world cities of varying distance from the equator.

Execution:
Randomly select at least 500 cities based on latitude and longitude.
Gather data on each city by making OpenWeatherMap API calls.
Save a CSV of the data.
Use Matplotlib to build scatter plots displaying the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Save png images for each scatter plot.
Write a breif description of three observable trends based on the data.
